# Poor man's notion clone (and also google forms)

This is a school project for the course "Web Oriented Architecture" at the University of Montpellier. You can access the website at [https://polynotes.do.moreiradj.net](https://polynotes.do.moreiradj.net). It's not my proudest, but it shows what I can do in a short amount of time. I've learned a lot about web development and especially about React and **why you need a state management library like Redux**. The lack of a state management library made the code very messy and hard to maintain.

Note: Just press `/` to open the options menu in the editor.

It used to be on gitlab as separate repositories for the backend and frontend, hence the weird commit history and the gitlab related files.

## Documentation

The documentation is in the `docs` folder, however the documentation is outdated concerning the deployment of the project. Especially concerning the mongodb database which is now a single node. I've also added helm charts for the deployment of the project on kubernetes.
